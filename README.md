# Worst Brighness UI
An awful UI for changing brightness on computers running macOS. To use, open terminal and run:

```python change-brightness.py```

then follow the on screen prompt. 

Uses your WPM from typing a small phrase to determine resulting screen brightness. Brightness is changed using applescript.
